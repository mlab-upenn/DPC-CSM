\section{Inversion of machine learning models for control}

\begin{itemize}
	\item challenges with constrained optimization using ML models
	\item hard because of non-convexities, non-differentiabilities, non-closed form solution, give examples with trees, forests, Gaussian processes, neural networks
	\item cannot use RL, we want model-based
	\item traditionally optimization in ML unconstrained
	\item for control we need constrained optimization
	\item examples of different applications â€“ building will be main focus
\end{itemize}
