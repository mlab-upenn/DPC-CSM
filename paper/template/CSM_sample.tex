IEEE Control Systems Magazine (CSM) articles are intended to inform the control engineering community of developments in specialized areas of control. Therefore, submissions must strive for high-quality exposition that explains the principal issues and challenges of their applications area. At least some of the introduction must be of a tutorial nature to introduce non-experts to the area of application. CSM papers are intended to be expository, which means that they explain things to nonexperts, assuming knowledge of control and systems theory at the graduate level. The opening section of the article can review the relevant literature. 
A sidebar can be used to survey the relevant literature. Sidebars are encouraged for self-contained digressions and tutorials.

\section[Use of References in a Sidebar]{Sidebar: Use of References in a Sidebar}
\label{sb:UseofRefs}
Here is some random text showing how references are handled for a sidebar. 
%\blindtext[1] 
Reference \cite{S1} gives one random reference. A basic equation is
\be f=ma, \label{eq_sb1}
\ee
and the impact of \eqref{eq_sb1} is highlighted in Figure~\ref{sb_fig1}. Reference \cite{S2} gives another random reference, but \cite{LT,BIB} are references in the main body of the text that can be cited in the sidebar.
