\begin{itemize}
\item Do not include an abstract. % No abstract is needed or allowed.
\item Do not number sections.  Center and boldface all section headings, and left-align and boldface all subsection headings. For subsubsection headings, use left justified, not bold, regular size font, italics.
\item Do not use footnotes of any kind or for any purpose. %No footnotes are allowed or used in any article published in IEEE CSM.
\item Use margins that are 1 inch on all sides allowing for US-size paper (\verb!\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}!). 
\item Punctuate every equation correctly within the context of the surrounding sentence.
\item You can use Word or LaTex, but \textit{LaTex is preferred for articles with numerous equations}. 
A LaTex template is available \cite{LT}.
\item Be sure that your references adequately capture prior relevant research. List references in the order of citation in the text. Use a dynamic citation process (such as bibtex or endnote) so that the references can be re-sorted if needed.
\item CSM encourages attractive illustrations, figures, and photos.  
Be sure that every figure has a detailed, informative caption in the Magazine style (see Figure~\ref{fig1}).
