\subsection{Formatting Instructions}

In preparing your article for the IEEE Control Systems Magazine (CSM), please note the following guidelines concerning layout and formatting. Please order the elements of your manuscript as follows:  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Title and subtitle.
\item Author names, clearly indicating point-of-contact author (with email address) on page 1.
\item Main text, with no heading for the first section, which is assumed to be the introduction.
\item References, beginning on a new page.
\item Each figure on a separate page with its caption, using (a), (b), (c) for subfigures. See ``\nameref{FTC}'' for details on figure caption style. In the text the subfigures should referenced as: Figure 2(a) and (b).
\item Each table on a separate page with its caption.  See below for details on table caption style.
\item Each sidebar beginning on a new page followed by its figures and tables labeled Figure S1, Table S1.  See below for more details on numbering figures, tables, and equations in sidebars. Each sidebar must be mentioned in the main text and the sidebars should be arranged in the same order that they are referenced in the text. 
\item On the last page, include a short biography of each author, beginning on a new page. 
\end{enumerate}
Each of these elements is described in detail in the following.


\subsection{Title and Subtitle}
IEEE CSM titles are in two parts, typeset in the exact style below.
The title should use initial caps and no colon.
The subtitle is on a separate line (note that only the first word is capitalized).
The subtitle should describe the content of the article.
Please choose the title and subtitle carefully.  Here is an example
\bc
{\Huge Control of Quantum Systems} \\
{\Large Subatomic phenomena\\
with application to feedback systems}
\ec
No colons should be used in either the title or the subtitle.  Avoid using the same word in both the title and subtitle.

\subsection{Main Text}

In assembling the main text, pay careful attention to the order of topics as well as the sectioning.  Choose section and subsection headings to reflect the material and to serve as a roadmap for the reader.
Do not provide a section heading at the beginning of your article, which IEEE CSM assumes is the introduction.
You can use subsubsection headings if you wish, but be sure to use them carefully so the reader can follow the layout.

Please use this style for review purposes:
\bi
\item[] Section heads:  Centered, bold, large font \verb!\section{}!
\item[] Subsection headings:  Left justified, bold, regular size font \verb!\subsection{}!
\item[] Subsubsection headings:  Left justified, not bold, regular size font, italics \verb!\subsubsection{}!
\ei
An example can be treated as a subsection or subsubsection.
