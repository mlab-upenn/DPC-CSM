\subsection{References}
All cited references must be publicly accessible.  Internal reports, theses, and dissertations are not viewed as being publicly accessible, and thus cannot be included in the reference list.  IEEE CSM is an archival publication, whose articles are backed up by other archival publications. However, obscure or unpublished documents that can be accessed from the web can be cited as long as the citation includes a URL address from which the document can be accessed.  In these cases, a website must be provided from which the document can be obtained.
All references need to be complete and accurately state the authors, title, volume, pages, and date.  Issue number is not crucial.

\subsubsection{Citation Style in the Text}
References must be listed in the order of citation in the text. Reference citations in the text must be bracketed numbers, that is, [3]-[5], [23]. For multiple nonsequential citations, separately bracket each number in numerical order, that is, [3], [5], [7].  In LaTex, the package 
\verb!\usepackage[compress]{cite}!  can be used to produce the required style.

Avoid mentioning authors by names in the text.  It is acceptable to mention illustrious names such as Newton and Bode, but please do not mention the names of contemporaries.  The passive voice is fine.  
\bi
\item Do not write  ``Jones [22] shows that...'',  instead write  ``It is shown in [22] that...''
\item Do not put {\tt http://} addresses in the text.  Rather, put all web addresses in the reference list as separate items.

\subsubsection{Bibliography Style and Guidelines}
The preferred style is listed below, but it is acceptable to use the standard IEEE bibstyle file \cite{BIB}.
\bi
\item Do not include private communications in the reference list.  The acknowledgments can be used for this purpose.
\item  Do not include full first names of authors, only initials.  Initials come first; that is, F. G. Smith.
\item  Do not use ``et al.''  Instead, always list all authors.
\item  For the title of an article, capitalize only the first word, and place the title in quotes.
\item  The names of journals and proceedings are italicized.
\item  Location is included for conferences.
\item  For journal articles, include vol. and no., lower case and abbreviated in each case, and set off with commas.  
\item Page numbers appear after the year of publication for conference proceedings and books, but before the year of publication for journals.
\item For documents available online, cite the location and date last accessed.
