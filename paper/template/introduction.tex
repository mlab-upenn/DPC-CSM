The specifics on a CSM article layout:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not include an abstract.  No abstract is needed or allowed.
\item Do not number sections.  Center and boldface all section headings, and left-align and boldface all subsection headings. For subsubsection headings, use non-bold font, left justified.
\item Do not use footnotes of any kind or for any purpose. No footnotes are allowed or used in any article published in IEEE CSM.
\item Use margins that are 1 inch on all sides, allowing for US size paper. 
\item Punctuate every equation correctly within the context of the surrounding sentence.
\end{itemize}

You may use Word or LaTex, but LaTex is preferred for articles with numerous equations. The LaTex template is available:\\
